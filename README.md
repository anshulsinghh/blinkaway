# FaceControl
A widget that allows users to map macros to certain facial movements. Currently the app only supports eye blinks, but yawning control is on the way as well. The app currently closes Netflix windows if the user blinks their eyes rapidly. More macros and facial detection abilities are on the way.

**This app is still a work in progress**, but the basic functionality is there. Additionally, this app only works for MacOSX only at the moment. This is because the app utilizes applescript to close out windows. The app also only closes Netflix in Google Chrome at the moment. I am working on improving the user interface, and adding support to closing more apps.
