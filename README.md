# BlinkAway
A widget that closes windows when the user blinks rapidly. This widget is for anyone who wants to fool around and watch/play games when they're not supposed to. If the user blinks rapidly, then all of their unwanted windows will dissapear.

This app is still a work in progress, but the basic functionality is there. Additionally, this app only works for MacOSX only at the moment. This is because the app utilizes applescript to close out windows. The app also only closes Netflix in Google Chrome at the moment. I am working on improving the user interface, and adding support to closing more apps.
